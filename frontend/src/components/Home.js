            <p>Welcome to PWSched! This app is designed to make scheduling public witnessing activities
                easy for service overseers and volunteers. Shifts are assigned in three easy steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Service Overseer creates public witnessing shifts for the congregation</li>
                <li>Congregation volunteers requests the shifts they'd like to work</li>
                <li>Service Overseer assigns shifts to volunteers</li>
            </ul>
        </>
    )
}
